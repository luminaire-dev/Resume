Hi there, I'm Leila. üëã

I create simple, elegant solutions for complex problems. I started my coding journey at age 10 when I discovered I could modify the source code to my neopets page. Fast forward to today: I‚Äôm building customer facing web and mobile banking solutions at ATB Financial. As the Lead Developer on the Business Banking Mobile project, I‚Äôm continuously striving to improve code quality, testing coverage, and delivery cycles to better serve our customers. I‚Äôm naturally curious, I love working on teams, and I‚Äôm one of those people who puts ketchup on their poutine. ü§≠
